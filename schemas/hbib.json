          "introBullets": "Here’s the thing: there is no baby—yet! \r\nPregnancy begins when sperm meets egg, and that’s not likely to have happened yet. \r\nBut technically, when you get that big fat positive, this will become week 2. ",
          "body": "Yep, confusing. But here’s how it works: When you find out you’re pregnant, your ob-gyn will clock your pregnancy due date by rewinding time to the first day of your last menstrual period—and from that count, this will be the second week of pregnancy, even though there’s no baby (yet!). This is done to standardize pregnancy gestational timeframes, since it’s really hard to pinpoint the actual moment of conception, which, in reality, won’t happen for another week or two. \r\nSo what’s really going on this week? Your body is getting ready for ovulation! That means your uterus is prepping for the potential of pregnancy—thickening the uterine lining with blood, amping up the estrogen and changing the consistency of the cervical mucus (to make it easier for sperm to access the newly released egg). Think of it as prime baby-making time. \r\n",
          "symptoms": "During the second week of “pregnancy,” your body is preparing itself for ovulation—and conception—with a few telltale signs. \r\n* “Egg white” cervical mucus. As you near ovulation, cervical mucus becomes thin, clear and stringy, like egg whites, to help sperm travel toward the egg.\r\n* A sharper sense of smell! This is probably nature’s way of helping you sniff out male pheromones in an effort to procreate.\r\n* Pelvic ache. As your ovary releases an egg, you might feel a little twinge in one side of your abdomen, known as Mittelschmerz—named for the doctor who first documented it.\r\n* Cervical changes. If you check your cervix routinely—something women who chart often do—you may notice it becomes higher, softer, and more open when you’re ovulating.\r\nStill not quite sure if you’re ovulating? A drugstore ovulation kit can help you track your cycle. Or try a low-tech strategy: have sex every other day from about day 12 to 16 of your menstrual cycle—meaning toward the end of the second week to the beginning of the third.\r\nIf you do conceive at 2 weeks pregnant, symptoms won’t appear right away. Pregnancy hormones won’t be detectable in your system until week 4 or later—and a missed period might clue you in by then. \r\nOther pregnancy symptoms to look out for: \r\n* Spotting. About 5 to 10 days after conception, you may notice a little spotting. This is caused by the embryo implanting itself into your uterine wall.\r\n* Sore boobs and/or darker areolas. Pretty much as soon as those hormones appear, a woman’s body starts prepping her boobs for breastfeeding.\r\n* Fatigue. Total exhaustion is some women’s first hint they’re expecting. That’s because your body will use a ton of energy to grow baby.\r\n",
